# I-Am-Rich-IOS-App

Sure, here's a summary of how you can create a simple iOS app using Xcode and Swift that includes a button and an image:

1. **Open Xcode**: Launch Xcode and create a new project.

2. **Select Template**: Choose the "Single View App" template and click "Next".

3. **Configure Project**: Fill in the details for your project (product name, organization identifier, etc.) and click "Next".

4. **Create Project**: Choose a location to save your project and click "Create".

5. **Design Interface**: In the storyboard file (usually named Main.storyboard), drag and drop a UIButton and a UIImageView onto the view controller.

6. **Connect Elements**: Ctrl-drag from the button to the view controller code to create an IBOutlet for the button and an IBAction for its touchUpInside event. Similarly, create an IBOutlet for the image view.

7. **Set Image**: In the ViewController.swift file, in the IBAction method you just created for the button, set the image property of the UIImageView to the image you want to display when the button is tapped. You can do this programmatically by using UIImage(named: "imageName").

8. **Build and Run**: Build and run your app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device. You should see the button and the image view displayed on the screen.

9. **Test the App**: Tap the button, and the image you specified should appear in the image view.

10. **Adjust as Needed**: You can further customize your app by adding more functionality, styling the button or image view, etc. Explore Xcode and the Swift language documentation for more options and features.

That's a basic summary of creating a simple iOS app using Xcode and Swift with a button and an image.
